**Outline:**
**Business Problem**
AB real estate is looking to use a strategy for their agents to maximise the total value of a home for all the parties involved.
For this, we need to identify selected features within King County home to indicate the most important aspects of these properties. This will also help the company gain trust between buyers and sellers, also establish their name within the industry. 
**Data**
We are using the King County House Sales dataset with a purpose of predicting the house prices within King County.  The data include around 21.5k data values of house sales for the properties sold during 2014 and 2015. 

**Data Science Process **
We used a mix of CRISP DM and OSMEIN process for this project.

Recommendations 1:
Higher sqft living translates into Increased value
The owners should be encouraged to opportunities to increase the living space of the property by adding some extra rooms/ sun roof to increase the value. They could look into renovating the property to add extra living sqft.

Recommendations 2 :
Value the waterfront:
When a property sits on a waterfront, its value is higher than the same property without a waterfront view. Its value is over 2x higher than the properties without a waterfront view.

Recommendations 3 :
Grade matters:
The KC grade has a strong impact on the housing prices. Properties with Excellent grades has a higher value as compared to properties with Lower grade. Home owners need to make efforts to raise the grade of their property to increase the sale price.

Recommendations 4 :
Condition of the home:
House conditions plays a vital role in determining the house prices. Houses with below 3 condition status has a lower price as compared to a house with a better condition of 4 or 5.

Conclusions:

Remember the features:
Increase Sqft Living
Waterfront determines value
Grade - excellent and above average homes acheive more price.
Condition - above 3 is preferred

Next steps:
Would like to know the features about the current home owners: Average income, age, children, if relatives live within the country
Get recent dataset to see how covid has impacted the house prices
To identify new trends
